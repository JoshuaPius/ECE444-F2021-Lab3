**Functional Requirement**: The application should provide users the ability to build their academic path. The current application only provides information about courses. There is no way to make selection and compile a collection of courses in order to determine if the courses will enable the user to graduate or achieve their desired minor or major credit/recognition. I would improve this by introducing a new widget to indicate if you are eligible to select the course one is viewing based on the courses you have indicated you have completed and based on the courses you have already selected.

**Non-Functional Requirement:** The application provides the functionality of differentiating courses based on academic year. However, I would improve the quality of this by making it a multi-select drop down. This is because as a third year you are able to take third, fourth and fifth year courses. Therefore if I want to know all courses I can take that pertains to the study of Docker Implementation I would need to perform 3 individual searches. But with a multi-select drop down, all of this will be compiled in one search action.
